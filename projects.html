    <h3>ALARM SYSTEM</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone has things they want to keep secure. Microchips provide a powerful new way of protecting valuables.</li>
        <li>In this project, students will build a simple alarm system that will turn on a buzzer and LED when the alarm is triggered by a 
pushbutton</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>
   
<div>
    <h3>TRAFFIC LIGHTS</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not only do people tell microchips what to do, microchips can also tell people 
what to do. Therefore, it is important that they are sending the correct message. 
        </li>
        <li>In this project, students will learn the importance of the instruction sequence and 
timing functions while building their own traffic light from LEDs.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    <h3>WASHING MACHINE</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Microchips have the ability to take over many tasks that 
once needed to be done by hand. However, these tasks 
often require a set of instructions to be carried out in a 
specific order.</li>
        <li>Students will learn more about giving instructions to microchips while they program their own washing machine.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>STREET LIGHTS</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Electric lighting has transformed the way people live. However, it is important not to 
waste energy.</li>
        <li>In this project, students will make a street light that only turns on when 
required.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>FRIDGE ALARM</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>The refrigerator is a very useful device that keeps our food 
from going bad.</li>
        <li>Students will be making their own fridge alarm to help keep food fresh and 
save electricity.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>THERMOSTAT</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>While no one likes being too hot or too cold, there are certain situations 
where keeping the temperature just right can mean the difference between 
life and death.</li>
        <li>Students will use the temperature controller in this project to 
monitor and adjust the temperature, similar to an incubator. </li>
    </ul>
