PROJECT 1: ALARM SYSTEM

* Everyone has things they want to keep secure. Microchips provide a powerful new way of protecting valuables.

* In this project, students will build a simple alarm system that will turn on a buzzer and LED when the alarm is triggered by a 
pushbutton.  

PROJECT 2: Traffic Lights

* Not only do people tell microchips what to do, microchips can also tell people 
what to do. Therefore, it is important that they are sending the correct message. 

* In this project, students will learn the importance of the instruction sequence and 
timing functions while building their own traffic light from LEDs.

PROJECT 3: Washing Machine

* Microchips have the ability to take over many tasks that 
once needed to be done by hand. However, these tasks 
often require a set of instructions to be carried out in a 
specific order. 

* Students will learn more about giving instructions to microchips while they program their own washing machine.

PROJECT 4: Street Lights

* Electric lighting has transformed the way people live. However, it is important not to 
waste energy. 

* In this project, students will make a street light that only turns on when 
required.

PROJECT 5: Fridge Alarm

* The refrigerator is a very useful device that keeps our food 
from going bad.

* Students will be making their own fridge alarm to help keep food fresh and 
save electricity.

PROJECT 6: Temperature Controller

* While no one likes being too hot or too cold, there are certain situations 
where keeping the temperature just right can mean the difference between 
life and death. 

* Students will use the temperature controller in this project to 
monitor and adjust the temperature, similar to an incubator.
